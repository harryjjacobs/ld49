# Entry for Ludum Dare 49

See how long you can stay alive in this procedurally generated world, before the ground collapses beneath your feet and the lava takes you...

Once again I didn't have a lot of time for this one so decided to keep it simple. Happy that I at least submitted something working.

Note - this is VERY bare-bones, didn't have time for any audio or even a title screen.

Had lots of other ideas for features like making the tiles fall faster as the game goes on, adding power-ups etc but didn't have time in the end.
I also want to improve the character movement and animation (especially jumping) as it can be frustrating to control at times.
